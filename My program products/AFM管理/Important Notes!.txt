Some program, like Nanoscope IIIa(z.exe), the main start excutable is
not the exe files we run but another one.

For example:
we run "D:\v443r8\Z.EXE" to excute the nanoscope software 
but actually "C:\WINNT\system32\ntvdm.exe" is monitored!

so the monitor path must be "C:\WINNT\system32\ntvdm.exe"!!

Use FindEXEPath.exe in this folder to identify the window is created by which
exe file.
